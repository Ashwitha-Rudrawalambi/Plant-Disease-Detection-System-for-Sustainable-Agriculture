# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

A Deep Learning-powered web application that enables early and accurate plant disease diagnosis from leaf images, supporting farmers in adopting sustainable agricultural practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaf images. The model is deployed via a **Streamlit web application**, allowing users to upload plant leaf images and receive instant predictions about potential diseases.

## 🎯 Features

- 📸 Upload a plant leaf image
- 🤖 Predicts from 35+ disease classes
- ⚙️ Built using TensorFlow and Streamlit
- 💻 Offline model inference – no internet needed for predictions
- 👨‍🌾 Easy-to-use interface tailored for non-technical users

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Model**: CNN trained on the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village)
- **Libraries**: NumPy, PIL, TensorFlow
